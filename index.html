				<p>The focus of this research is on Bangladesh and the severity of their natural disasters.
					This involves two main sets of data, natural disaster levels and population which would be displayed
					according to each
					district.
					We collected data of Bangladesh’s monthly rainfall data from 1948-2014.
					Experimenting with ways to visualise it, we have plotted the data on a map and animated the
					visualisation according to its data. The images below show the first four
					iterations to achieve a better understanding of the best way to visualize the main factors.

				<p>I am a student in Design Computing at the University of Sydney. My passion
					is programming and learning new programming languages. I have start
					programming with P5.js which is an interactive JavaScript DOM library.
					Combing this knowledge with complex data sets I have found great potential
					in my self in the field of data visualization and data mining.
					I am a curious person who likes to look at problems from different points of
					view to generate and iterate new ideas. I enjoy working in groups and share
					my insights with others. this has improved my abilities in the field of user
					experience designs.</p>

					In addition, Web Development is a combination of all my passions
					altogether. This skill provides me with tools to showcase information in an
					interactive and responsive environment. My JavaScript skills have improved
					my performance in bringing static web pages alive.
