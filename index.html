				<p>The focus of this research is on Bangladesh and the severity of their natural disasters.
					This involves two main sets of data, natural disaster levels and population which would be displayed
					according to each
					district.
					We collected data of Bangladesh’s monthly rainfall data from 1948-2014.
					Experimenting with ways to visualise it, we have plotted the data on a map and animated the
					visualisation according to its data. The images below show the first four
					iterations to achieve a better understanding of the best way to visualize the main factors.

						Technology has played a significant role in increasing the world population dramatically.
						Consequently it has increased the level of the complexity of problems.
						However, user research methods developed around design frameworks can be a powerful tool to
						face these complex wicked problems.
						since the day I was introduced to the digital world, I have always been looking and thinking
						beyond the applications and platforms I have used.
						The temptation to find reliable solutions to build a better future for both humanity and

						Currently our planet is at a critical point of animal extinction and bidovirsty loss.
						To aid in combatting this loss we have designed the Atmoscube. Through research conducted at
						the beginning of the design process we’ve identified that people often feel unempowered
						in their ability to help the environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						To solve this problem, we have aimed to create an experience that informs and engages the user
						in an effort to educate and empower. Empowerment provided by interacting with the atomscube is
						designed to permeate throughout the users daily life, providing them with a platform to continue
						with environmentally positive life choices.

						The design process was guided by the aim of empowering people through education in an effort to

						Stage one of the design process involved conducting research

						Stage two of the process involved studying the research gathered,
						finding explicit and intrinsic insights into solutions for the problem space.

						Stage Three involved each design member submitting two idea and subsequent storyboards
