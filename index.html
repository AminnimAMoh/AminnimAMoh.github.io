                    As a designer, I always looking around many web pages to find the best color palette for my
                    projects. During my studies, it came to my mind that the natural word represents the most cohesive
                    color mixing. That could be the reason we enjoy natural sceneries.
                    Also, I wandered to generate a tool to use other designers' color choices boosting the process of
                    color finds. I know many similar pages exist on the Internet as color palette generators. However,
                    one of the main reasons for starting
                    this project was no access to the Internet when I was on the train. Since I start to write this
                    algorithm to be able to extract major colors constructing any image I drop in to.

                        Currently our planet is at a critical point of animal extinction and bidovirsty loss. To aid in
                        combatting this loss we have designed the Atmoscube. Through research conducted at the beginning
                        of the design process we’ve identified that people often feel
                        unempowered in their ability to help the environment.

                    <p>
                        To solve this problem, we have aimed to create an experience that informs and engages the user
                        in an effort to educate and empower. Empowerment provided by interacting with the atomscube is
                        designed to permeate throughout the users daily life, providing

                    with backend data collection to read, write and update the platform
                    elements instantly. React.js allows for clear front-end code organisation. React.js also separates
                    the HTML,CSS, and JavaScript of each page to a separate component. By organizing each page in a
                    separate class it is possible to pass
                    arguments between pages. This interconnection between pages significantly helps handle users’

                            "useState" is a React hook function that allows us to change the state of the function components if required.
                            React hook functions are well design to secure the function component from possible errors in the code as well as stabilizing the connection between components between classes.

                    <li><h3>useEffect</h3>
                        <p>
                            "useEffect" function is another React hook that allows us to read from our API data base only on specified circumstances. 
                            "useEffect" helps us to minimize the tokens on our API and reduces the load on the API server.
                            In this application, we mainly use the "useEffect" hook to read and write on our API database with a minimum number of tokens for each request to maintain the API service.

                            <li>useHistory
                                <p>
                                    "useHistory" is a hook function from React Router Core npm to trigger the Link function in a class function rather than the render function.
                                    "useHistory" in this application allows us to route between pages using different states of function components in conditions.  
                                    In this application, this condition listens to the direction of the user's swipe.

                                <p>
                                    "Switch" is unique in that it renders a route exclusively. In contrast, every "Route" that matches the location renders inclusively.

                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    "Route" most basic responsibility is to render some UI when its path matches the current URL passed as the path.
                                    "Route" also sets the props required for the routing component and on each request to the path it makes the hook between the sender and receiver component. 
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    "Link" allows us to navigate to specified path component/page in HTML format (render function) and transferring object properties as props.
                                    In this application, we have used "Link" on our buttons triggering routes to other pages and transferring the props to the function component.

                <p>
                    Firebase is Google's free cloud storage that handles many aspects of backend functionality. For this
                    project, this service allows reservation of questions and users results in a form of API data
                    sources as well as deploying the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One firebase data document is used to reserve the questions in. This allows for easy updates of the
                    questions and answers. Changes are instantly applied to the application without any page refresh
                    required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second data document collects the users’ final results as well as their postcode. After a user
                    is done the result and postcode of the question will be saved on this repository in the form of an
                    array of objects. This information instantly will be
                    downloaded from the API to draw the graph in the next page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thirdly, Google Firebase helps build and deploy the application on its servers from React.js. Google
                    fiFirebase provides this service for free in addition to all other mentioned services.

                <p>
                    This is a pre-build swipe listener library that provides a very smooth swipe animation to given
                    elements. Using this library on questions card as clear user feedback on their swipe actions. This
                    library also allows the application to count the correct
                    answers as well as the total number of questions answered. Using the ”onSwipe” listener built-in on
                    this library we can monitor the direction the swipe user makes for each question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    React router library: this library allows the application to easily move between pages. This library
                    allows for multiple pages in the application. Separating actions and information in different pages
                    improves the flow of the application. A benefit of
                    this separation is the minimisation of the amount of information users have to process at a time.

                    D3.js: this JavaScript library is a very powerful tool to bring the data to life with interactive
                    graphs as well as manipulating DOM elements. Using the data restored in Firebase cloud service shows
                    an overview of the average score for each suburb using
                    postcodes from user inputs. This leaderboard also graph shows the total number of participants from
                    each suburb to explain the differences more clearly.
